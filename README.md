# Preserved Food for Don't Starve Together

# Features

Adds a new way to store food indefinitely.

You can only store raw ingredients and a few dishes. Containers can be either opened to get back some of the ingredients used, or cooked to get back cooked ingredient. By default the number of items you get by opening or cooking is less than the number of raw items used initially, but you can set your own settings.

These are all the ingredients that can be preserved: Cave Bananas, Berries, Carrots, Corn, Durians, Dragonfruits, Eels, Eggplants, Fish, Honey, Juicy Berries, Mushrooms, Pomegranates, Pumpkins, Watermelons, Light Bulbs, Glow Berries, Lesser Glow Berries. If Birds and Berries and Fruits and Trees for Friends mod is enabled: Apples, Blueberries, Greenberries, Pineapples. If More Fruits mod is enabled: Grapes, Lemons, Limes, Oranges, Strawberries, Tomatoes.

By default, preserving also requires a certain amount of Honey and Nitre. Both can be disabled or modified in the settings.

The recipe tab and building requirement can be changed in the settings as well, however you always have to be standing near that respective building in order to be able to craft.
